# File to specify Force.com organization information
# which is used in running Force.com SDK functional
# tests.
#
# This file may contain Force.com credentials and 
# therefore should *never* be published outright.
# It is akin to a Maven settings.xml file and should
# be treated as such.
#

# --------------------------------------------------
# Force.com endpoint information
# --------------------------------------------------

# The Force.com endpoint.
# e.g. endpoint=login.salesforce.com
endpoint=prerelna1.pre.salesforce.com

# The protocol used to connect to the Force.com endpoint.
# e.g. endpoint.protocol=https
endpoint.protocol=https

# The Force.com API version to test against.
# e.g. force.apiVersion=22
force.apiVersion=22


# --------------------------------------------------
# Force.com organization / user information
# --------------------------------------------------

# The username used to connect to the Force.com
# test organization.
# e.g. user=username@organization.com
user=john@sdktest.com

# The password used to connect to the Force.com
# test organization.
# e.g. password=password123
password=123456

# The token for logging in through the api. You can reset 
# this in Setup through My Personal Information > Reset My Security Token
# Leave this value blank if api security tokens are disabled.
api.security.token=T5RaOKYSlcSbKtlWQzxhQAacS

# The namespace of the Force.com test organization.
# This is used to verify correctness in certain tests.
# A blank value is acceptable if the Force.com test
# organization has no namespace.
# e.g. force.namespace=javacloud_ns
# You can set your namespace on a Developer Edition Org in Setup
# by going through the menu Create > Packages
force.namespace=johnsdktest

# --------------------------------------------------
# Force.com OAuth information
# --------------------------------------------------
# In order to execute OAuth and SpringSecurity tests
# is is necessary to register an OAuth consumer
# in the Force.com test organization.  This can be
# done on the in the Setup page under Develop > Remote Access.
#
# Please keep two things in mind when registering an
# OAuth consumer:
#
# 1. The Callback URL *must* be set to http://localhost:8888/force-app/_auth
#    Failing to do this will cause certain tests to fail
#    (springsecurity-integration-test).
# 2. You *must* check the box for "No user approval required
#    for users in this organization".  Failing to do this
#    will cause certain tests to fail
#    (springsecurity-integration-test).

# The OAuth key of the OAuth consumer
# registered in the Force.com test organization.
force.test.oauth.key=3MVG9lKcPoNINVBKCrZZRtcd1yqZctsdLq43N1.c8tLtNwsuuAn53X2R5BtMKmLepzR8w81dx.Fj14E3.JE5W

# The OAuth secret of the OAuth consumer
# registered in the Force.com test organization.
